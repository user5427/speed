# PSI project repository.

# How to push and pull:
- Before committing to the project, please make sure that you are on a separate branch. **Avoid committing directly to the main branch.**
- Create a pull request when you want to merge your work with the main branch. 
- When approving a pull request, please **choose** the **Squash and merge** option instead of the default Create a merge commit. (These options are only visible on GitHub.com.). Squash and merge is used to keep commit history in the main branch clean.

## Team
Currently, this is 4 people team.
Team members will be added later.

## Project speed
Possible project themes:
* speed reading with typing (focus on memory?)
* speed reading with questions after reading
* speed reading a sentence with question afterward (source texts from VBA? or other sources)
* žodynas
* mouse tracker text?
* speed redrawing (could not find this idea online)
