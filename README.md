# How to push and pull:
Before committing to the project, please make sure that you are on a separate branch. **Avoid committing directly to the main branch.**

## Project speed
Possible project themes:
* speed reading with typing (focus on memory?)
* speed reading with questions after reading
* speed reading a sentence with question afterward (source texts from VBA? or other sources)
* žodynas
* mouse tracker text?
* speed redrawing (could not find this idea online)
