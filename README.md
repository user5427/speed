# PSI project repository.

# How to push and pull:
Before commiting to the project please make sure that you are on a seperate branch. **Avoid commiting directly to main branch.**
Create a pull request when you want to merge your work with the main branch.

## Team
Currently this is 4 people team.
Team members will be added later.

## Project speed

* speed reading with typing (more about memory??)
* speed reading with questions after reading
* speed reading a sentence with question after (take texts from VBA?? texts from something else)
* žodynas
* mouse tracker text?
* speed redrawing (could not find this idea on web)
