- [Alpha](Info/versions/Alpha.md)
- [Beta](Info/versions/Beta.md)
- [Final](Info/versions/Final.md)


### Project goal:
To create a speedreading application with questions after every paragraph. 
The application will be used for **educational purposes**.
Users will be able to **learn** new information **faster** about topics they are interested in.

### Project working principle:
The user will choose the topic of the article and the reading speed.
The user will read the selected article as fast as possible and, to test their comprehension, answer questions related to the text.
The user will be able to see the statistics of his reading speed and improvment over time.
